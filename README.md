# XAI  
Repository for Model-Agnostic Techniques in Explainable AI (XAI).  

## Model-Agnostic Techniques  
This repository explores various model-agnostic XAI techniques using an **XGBoost model** trained on a dataset from the **SHAP library**. The techniques implemented include:  

1. **LIME** â€“ Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations for instance-level insights.  
2. **Shapley Values** â€“ A game-theoretic approach to fairly distributing feature contributions.  
3. **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** â€“ A unified framework combining Shapley values with visualization tools.  
4. **Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE)** â€“ Instance-specific effect of a feature on model predictions.  
5. **Anchor** â€“ High-precision rule-based explanations for local model behavior.  

## Notebook  
ðŸ“‚ **local_explanation.ipynb** â€“ Contains implementation and analysis of the above techniques on the dataset.
